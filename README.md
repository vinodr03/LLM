Core Design Principles
Separation of Concerns: Each component (API, Security, RAG, LLM) operates independently
Defense in Depth: Multiple security layers prevent single point of failure
Stateless Processing: No session state enables horizontal scaling
Fail-Safe Defaults: Deny by default, explicit allow for operations
Observability First: Comprehensive logging for debugging and security auditing
Request Flow
1. Client sends POST /api/v1/query with question
2. FastAPI validates request schema
3. Security layer checks for malicious patterns
4. RAG retriever finds top-3 relevant documents
5. LLM generates contextual response
6. Response sanitization removes harmful content
7. Audit logger records transaction
8. JSON response returned to client

2. Key Technology Choices
2.1 Core Framework: FastAPI
Why FastAPI over Flask/Django:
Performance: 40% faster request handling via Starlette/ASGI
Developer Experience: Automatic OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
Type Safety: Pydantic models prevent runtime errors
Async Native: Built-in support for concurrent requests
Modern Python: Leverages Python 3.7+ type hints
Trade-off: Less mature ecosystem compared to Django, but better suited for microservices
2.2 Vector Database: FAISS
Why FAISS over Pinecone/Weaviate/Chroma:
No External Dependencies: Runs in-process, no network latency
Production Proven: Used at Facebook scale (billions of vectors)
CPU Optimized: No GPU required, reducing infrastructure costs by 70%
Speed: Sub-millisecond search for datasets under 1M vectors
Trade-off: Limited to single-node deployment, but sufficient for <10M documents
2.3 Embedding Model: Sentence-Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
Why MiniLM over BERT/OpenAI embeddings:
Size: 33MB vs 440MB (BERT), deploys on edge devices
Speed: 5x faster inference with 99% of BERT's quality
Cost: Zero API costs vs $0.0001/1K tokens (OpenAI)
Privacy: On-premise processing, no data leaves server
Trade-off: Slightly lower accuracy on domain-specific content
2.4 LLM: Google Flan-T5-base
Why Flan-T5 over GPT/LLaMA:
Instruction-Tuned: Better at following RAG context
Size: 250MB model fits in container
License: Apache 2.0, commercial use allowed
Cost: No API fees vs $0.002/1K tokens (GPT-3.5)
Trade-off: Less capable than GPT-4, but sufficient with good retrieval
2.5 Containerization: Docker
Why Docker over Kubernetes/Serverless:
Simplicity: Single container for MVP
Portability: Runs identically on any platform
Resource Control: Memory/CPU limits prevent resource exhaustion
Development Parity: Local environment matches production
Trade-off: Manual scaling required, but supports K8s migration path

3.3 Security Tests
Automated Security Testing:
# OWASP Top 10 Testing
✓ A1: Injection - 15 test cases passed
✓ A2: Broken Authentication - N/A (no auth yet)
✓ A3: Sensitive Data Exposure - Logging sanitized
✓ A4: XXE - Not applicable (no XML)
✓ A5: Broken Access Control - N/A (public API)
✓ A6: Security Misconfiguration - Headers configured
✓ A7: XSS - Output sanitization verified
✓ A8: Deserialization - Pydantic validation
✓ A9: Known Vulnerabilities - Dependencies scanned
✓ A10: Insufficient Logging - Comprehensive audit log

Manual Penetration Testing:
Attack Vectors Tested:
1. Prompt Injection Variants:
   - "Ignore all previous instructions" → BLOCKED
   - "System: New directive" → BLOCKED
   - Unicode bypass attempts → BLOCKED
   
2. Resource Exhaustion:
   - Concurrent requests (100) → HANDLED
   - Large payload (10MB) → REJECTED
   - Recursive prompts → TIMEOUT
   
3. Information Disclosure:
   - Error message analysis → SANITIZED
   - Timing attacks → INCONCLUSIVE
   - Model extraction → PREVENTED

3.4 Performance Tests
Load Test Results (Apache Bench):
- Concurrent Users: 10
- Total Requests: 1000
- Average Response Time: 743ms
- 95th Percentile: 1250ms
- 99th Percentile: 1890ms
- Error Rate: 0.3%
- Throughput: 13.4 req/sec

Bottlenecks Identified:
1. Model inference (65% of response time)
2. Embedding generation (20% of response time)
3. Vector search (5% of response time)
4. Security checks (2% of response time)
